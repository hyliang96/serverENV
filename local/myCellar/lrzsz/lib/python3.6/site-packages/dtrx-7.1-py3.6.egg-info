Description: dtrx extracts archives in a number of different
              formats; it currently supports tar, zip (including self-extracting
              .exe files), cpio, rpm, deb, gem, 7z, cab, rar, and InstallShield
              files.  It can also decompress files compressed with gzip, bzip2,
              lzma, xz, or compress.
        
              In addition to providing one command to handle many different archive
              types, dtrx also aids the user by extracting contents consistently.
              By default, everything will be written to a dedicated directory
              that's named after the archive.  dtrx will also change the
              permissions to ensure that the owner can read and write all those
              files.
